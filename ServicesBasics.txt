a) Dependency Injection- is ability to add the functionality of components at runtime.

b) Services- 1)allow us to create reusable common shared functionality between various modules and components.
	  2)Services are Singleton
	  3)services are injected into appn. using dependency injection mechanism.
	  4)we need to create and inject services in components where we want to use them.
	  5)services are commonly used for making http request to backend api or endpoint.

c) Generate service- 
	1)ng generate service <service_name> or ng g service <service_name>
	2)import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';

d)where should we keep services- 
inside src/app -> create folder services

e)whats inside service.ts file?
-> @Injectable
	->works on dependency injection mechanishm
->ProvidedIn
	->its available wherever we inject it

f) Do we need to import in any module file?
-> NO
-> Only import in the components where we want to use.

g)Import the service in any component
   ->create instance in constructor
   ->call the method using instance of the service
